        <h1>Contact me</h1>
        <p>
          I’m here to listen and support you on your journey. Whether you have a question, need advice, or just want to talk, feel free to reach out.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve always been sensitive to the energies around me, and over time, I discovered my psychic abilities. This led me to dedicate myself to something greater—the pursuit of helping others on their spiritual journeys.
        </p>

        <p>
          I offer talk therapy and general advice on a donation basis. For astrology readings, energy healing, and other premium services, I charge a fee.
        </p>

        <p>
          To get in touch, email me at <my-email subject="Hey, found you through your webpage"></my-email>. I’ll respond as soon as I can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking forward to connecting!
        </p>
