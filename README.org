*** TODO Final index page

** Proper build version
*** TODO Set up build based on CLJ or Babashka
- Squint works from CLJ, so Cherry should too (I asked @borkdude in #Cherry Slack).
- Do I need separate repos for main/blog/wiki (think Netlify deploy).
  - If so, I need a shared package that has config, components, CSS vars and whatnot.
- Minify/Uglify JS & CSS on build. Possibly add timestamp to reload cache ?t=timestamp.
- GA only in the production build.
- <term name="satori"> like abbr, but more interactive, consider desktop/mobile.
- Build-time checks: make sure the components exists, compile it.
- Move Cherry code into a ~component~ macro that will write the Cherry component on the disk. Keep everything in src, pages should be all generated (CSS? SVG?)

*** TODO Thank @borkdude
- Will I want to rename the repo?
- Cherry fucking rocks! Also this source can serve as a reference of a real-world project using Cherry.

** TODO Version with a blog
*** TODO Override the back button behaviour
So things don't get reloaded.

*** TODO Dynamic page URLs
We either:
- No longer have all the various static HTML pages and only have 1 SPA-style HTML like index.html that links app.js.
- Or we handle the blog as a separate app on a separate subdomain. This would be preferable for speed and other concerns.

** Nice to have
*** TODO Dark mode

* Links
- [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/jakubstastny/tree/rel?tab=readme-ov-file#links][Production links]] such as Netlify and Google Analytics console as well as links to pages that link the site (YouTube Studio and my Reddit).
