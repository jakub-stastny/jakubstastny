* Tasks
** Pre-release
*** TODO Kick off: index page
*** TODO Final styles
*** TODO Final about page
*** TODO Final contact page

*** TODO Sponsorships
- Buy me a coffee? I already have.
- Patreon.
- PayPal.
- All these are in Reddit, add in the [[https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile?rdt=54962][settings]].

** Version 1
*** TODO Thank @borkdude
Cherry fucking rocks! Also this source can serve as a reference of a real-world project using Cherry.

** TODO Version with a blog
*** TODO Override the back button behaviour
So things don't get reloaded.

*** TODO Dynamic page URLs
We either:
- No longer have all the various static HTML pages and only have 1 SPA-style HTML like index.html that links app.js.
- Or we handle the blog as a separate app on a separate subdomain. This would be preferable for speed and other concerns.

** Nice to have
*** TODO Dark mode
