* Tasks
** Pre-release
*** TODO Index page

** Version 1
*** TODO Update my social media links
Use the ~?from=reddit~ QS.

*** TODO Add Google Analytics

*** TODO Thank @borkdude
Cherry fucking rocks! Also this source can serve as a reference of a real-world project using Cherry.

** TODO Version with a blog
*** TODO Override the back button behaviour
So things don't get reloaded.

*** TODO Dynamic page URLs
We either:
- No longer have all the various static HTML pages and only have 1 SPA-style HTML like index.html that links app.js.
- Or we handle the blog as a separate app on a separate subdomain. This would be preferable for speed and other concerns.
