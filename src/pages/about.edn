 [[:h1 "About me"]
  [:p "From a young age, I was the black sheep—always different, always asking questions that others didn’t. This sense of being an outlier gave me the ability to see deeply into people and the world around me. When you’re not inside the box, you can truly see it for what it is."]
  [:p "I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity about the nature of reality. While others were caught up in the rat race, I found myself questioning its purpose, sensing its shallowness. That’s not to say I avoided the world—in fact, I’ve embraced it. I’ve travelled extensively, immersed myself in different cultures, learned languages, and built a career and a family. These experiences have enriched my understanding, but they’ve also reinforced a simple truth: spirituality isn’t about escaping reality; it’s about engaging with it fully."]
  [:p "For me, true spiritual practice isn’t about castles in the clouds—it’s about living in a way that brings contentment, peace, and bliss. It’s about finding balance and being present in the moment, whether that’s at home with my wife and dogs or guiding others on their journey."]
  [:p "As a spiritual guide, I’m here to help you navigate your own path. My approach is practical and grounded, rooted in the belief that spirituality should enhance your life, not complicate it. When you’re successful in your practice, you’ll find a deeper sense of peace and the ability to positively touch the lives of others."]
  [:p "I’ve always found the most satisfaction in helping people, using my unique perspective and abilities to support them on their journey. Whether you’re seeking clarity, growth, or simply a deeper understanding of yourself, I’m here to guide you."]
