 [[:h1 "About me"]
  [:p "Iâ€™ve always been the black sheep of the family. I didn't enjoy the activities that I as a boy was supposed to enjoy, like football. My biggest joy has always been the nature, walking in the countryside and " [:strong "observing silently"] "."]
  [:p "While my peers were go-go-go, without giving much thought to where is it exactly they were going, I was " [:strong "deeply questioning"] " the path that everyone seemed to be so convinced I must trod on. My inner stillness allowed me to listen to my intuition and drop out of secondary school, something that in my conservative home town pissed off everyone, but I knew my path was different."]
  [:p "Shortly I found myself in London, improving my very poor English and working as a programmer. My " [:strong "deep curiosity"] " about life made me use most of my money for travelling and I spent over a decade meeting new cultures and people from all walks of life, seeing what they were up to and what life was about."]
  [:p "When I was 27, I moved to Barcelona. I lived in a camper van parked 10 minutes from the beach in what was then a rough, but slowly gentrifying neighbourhood. I felt a real urge to start " [:strong "meditation"] ". I did, using the Headspace app (thank you Andy!) and to my big surprise there were noticeable changes to how I felt in just one month of 10-15 minutes long meditations. I kept meditating, on and off, and one day I started to feel energies around me."]
  [:p "At the age of 30 I moved to Mexico City and had my " [:strong "psychic opening"] " there. I started to get premonitions that came true, visions and was able to communicate with passed-away beings. While that was fun, the real gift for me was " [:strong "healing"] ", which to my greatest surprise found I was able to do with great results. Prior to this I only knew Reiki, I used to go to sessions fairly regularly, but it wasn't even scratching the surface of the healing that was coming through me."]
  [:p "I shared these things with my good friend of many years, a wise older woman from Ireland called Patricia. She turned out to be a very acute psychic, and more importantly realised the Self already in her teens and she " [:strong "guided me"] " through my own awakening 4 years later. She made a huge impact on me and I immediately knew that what I really want to do in my life was to guide people and help them out on their own healing and awakening journey."]
  [:p "Apart from Patricia and her impact on my life, the " [:a {:href :self-realisation} "Self-realisation"] " itself had an immense impact. I used to suffer from deep depression, I was a heavy drinker with very poor sense regarding to choosing my partners. The awakening wipe all this out. Sure, it was a gradual work of these 4 years, but the big change really happened upon awakening and upon stabilising the realisation."]
  [:p "I want to share these insights with others, so they can also live in " [:em "peace beyond all understanding"] ", from a place of true freedom."]
